    <h1>Welcome, my name is June!</h1>
    My birthday is February 21, 2003 and I am about to be a junior in highschool.  I have two younger sisters named Ginger and Holly.  In my free time I am a volunteer with Search and Rescue. I am 5’9” and my favorite color is <span class="blueText">blue</span>.  Some fun facts about me are that I am a black belt in Tae Kwon Do,
    I am obsessed with firetrucks, and I play the stand up bass.

      I love adventuring, especially with my dad. This is us in front of monkey rock in Japan.
